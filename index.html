& below a rundown of what's up and probs answers to most of ur questions;)

------------------------------------------->

💗 WHY WE'RE HERE?

💗 TO REMEMBER

💗 LINEUP/SCHEDULE

💗 FAQ

💗 COMMUNITY QUIDELINES

💗 ACCESSIBILITY INFO

-------------------------------------------------->



💥 ... pride just a party?💥

>NO! Remember to take part in actions also during the week. 

The protest is the axxion, then we come together for this afterparty. ;) 

PALESTINE-bloc, dyke march and the protest-block by @transpolitiikkaa in the pride-march all the way! <3


💥how can a party/pride be resistance?💥

>> By talking about what is happening around us and including it in your social spaces, with the people u invite etc. Celebrating without acknowledging the world around us feels dishonest... so rather than use this space of gathering to escaping the reality, let's go trough and grow together! <3<3


💥what does queer solidarity in practise mean?💥 

> ok, so we know there's a g3n0c1de of the people of Pal3stine, we know of Sudan & Congo too.
So fuck these zi000n1st n444zi i5r4h3ll u5a licking boots whiner ass shit fake-state imperialists!

> we stand together w/ our global family of resistance, together we fight against this white supremicst, g3n0c1dal, hyper capitalistic, hetero-cis normative-trans-homophobic violent d3ath machine.

As a shared front of solidarity we'll show how loud, angry and loving we are!


>Also: [Enter own anwser here] and then contextualize it to this party & ur everyday life!



💥ALSO the local TEA is...💥

... that our kokoomus president Stubb as this year's "official protector of pride" hasn't lift a finger to materialise his support for ensuring safe trans-queer lives.

... all while gladly supporting the k1ll1ng of innocent people trough armstrade & diplomatic ties with Irs4h3ll and NATO (usa).

... and while the official commercial Helsinki Pride has layed off whistleblowers / people working towards improving the companys practises of equity...

WE SAY: FCK NO! NOT IN OUR NAME! 

Our pride, resistance and solidarity is not for sale for yt supremicist agenda!

💥💥💥💥


NONE OF US ARE FREE UNTIL EVERYBODY'S FREE
SELF DETERMINATION TO ALL QUEERS AND INDEGINEOUS PPL & LAND
FR33 PAL3STINE

NO PRIDE IN G3N0C1D3

PROTECT TRANS KIDS & FAMILIES EVERYWHERE
TRANS RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS

💥💥💥

we get trough together, thank you <3
RANT OVER XOXOX
